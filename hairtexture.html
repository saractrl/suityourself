 <h1 class="titles1"> Hair textures/types</h1>
<p class="titles2">What are hair textures/types?  </p>
  <!--Description of hair texture-->
<p class="text2">Hair texture describes how thin or thick single strands of your hair are, you can have fine hair and curly hair. <br/>
Today we mostly speak about thin, medium, and thick or coarse hair texture. <br/>
On this page, we will not go into detail about texture but focus more on hair type. <br/>
Simply explained, hair type determines whether you have straight, wavy, curly, or kinky-curly hair. <br/> </p>

<!--Straight hair-->
<p id="straight" class="titles2"> Straight hair</p> 
<p class="text2">Like every other hair type, straight hair also has three categories, which are not much talked about, due to the minor differences. <br/>
  Straight hair is the hair type that needs the least amount of care, but it comes with its difficulties like not having enough volume, hairstyles not holding and too much production of oil. <br/></p>

</div>
<!--Text-->

  <p class="text2">1A hair is the straightest hair on the spectrum.</p>
  <p class="text2">1B hair is still quite straight but it has a medium-thick texture.</p>
  <p class="text2">1C hair has the coarsest texture out of all straight hair.</p>

  <p class="text2">Please read the <a href=hairporosity.html>porosity</a> section, because that will help you the most.
     In general, we recommend straight hair to use a mild shampoo, find the right conditioner based on your porosity type, avoid brushing wet hair and trim your hair every found to twelve weeks!

<p class="text2">2A hair is fine and has “S-shaped” waves.</p>
<p class="text2">2B hair has medium texture.</p>
<p class="text2">2C hair is coarse and prone to frizz.</p>
<p class="text2">Please read the <a href=hairporosity.html>porosity</a> section, because that will help you the most.
In general, keep your hair moisturized, comb with your fingers and use your fingers to define your waves.
Aussie hair, which is sold at "Coop City" is seen as the best brand for your wavy hair and it is affordable. <br/>

<!--Curly hair-->
<p id="curly" class="titles2">Curly hair</p>
<p class= "text2">Finally, we get to the category that inspired this website. Most curly-headed people have struggled with their hair growing up,
  so we wanted to give you a little bit of guidance. When it comes to curly hair, we also have three categories. 
  Of course, you can have a mix of all the categories but here come the differences between the hair textures.</p>

<p class="text1" id="typea">3A </p>
<p class="text1" id="typeb">3B</p>
<p class="text1">3C</p>
</div>
<!--Text-->

<p class= "text2">3B hair has tighter curls.</p>
<p class= "text2">3C hair has the tightest type of curl and probably starts curling up more from the root on.</p>
<p class= "text2">3A hair has the largest circumference of all the different curl types,
  which means each curl is looser and bigger.</p>

  <p class="text2">Please read the <a href=hairporosity.html>porosity</a> section, because that will help you the most.
  As a summary, don't overwash your hair, detangle gently, always style your hair when (soaking) wet, scruch your curls and experiment!

<p class="text1" id="typeb">4B</p>
<p class="text1">4C</p>
</div>
<!--Text-->
<p class="text2">
  This is the hair type that is mostly if not only found in people of African descent. It’s the driest hair type, so it might be a little fragile. </p>
<p class="text2">4A hair has very tight spirals </p>
<p class="text2">4B hair also has tight spirals but it appears less defined. People with 4C hair experience more shrinkage, so it appears shorter than it is. </p>
<p class="text2">4C hair again is less defined than 4B hair. </p>

<p class="text2">Please read the <a href=hairporosity.html>porosity</a> section, because that will help you the most.
To sum it up, shampoo you hair with sulfate-free shampoos, wet your hair at least once a week and moisturize it well, use a bonnet or satin scarf to sleep at night.
