    <!--Porosity definition-->
    <div id="porosity-box">
	  <p class="titles3">â€¦but wait, what is hair porosity? </p>
<p class="text1">Hair porosity determines how much moisture your hair can absorb and retain. 
          The more porous (more "holes") your cuticle is, the more it can absorb moisture, more information below.</p>
            <img src="imgs/hairporosity.jpg" id="img">
        </div>
                
<!--Low porosity hair-->
<p id="low" class="text1">Low porosity hair <br/> <br/>
  On the microscopic level having low porosity hair means that your hair lies very flat, which means that there are very few gaps where water can enter.
  In result to that the hair has issues absorbing water, but if it does absorb moisture it can retain it for longer, as the gaps are very tight. <br/>
 <br/>
  Using steam in your hair routine can help to relax the hair cuticle and allow water vapor to enter the hair. 
  You can use a shower cap while you have a warm shower to create heat. <br/>
  If you've read our <a href="dry.html#ha">hydrate </a> section in dry skin, you've learned that hyaluronic acid can help trap moisture in. 
  This surprisingly works for the hair as well, so look for products that have that in their ingredients. <br/>
  In combination with steam you can also use lightweight oils. 
  Based on <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12715094/">a study</a> coconut has been seen as the most helpful oil to use.

  A general rule for low porosity hair is not to use too much product to not weigh down the hair.
 <br/> <br/>

  <ul id="low" class="text1">
    Avoid:
    <li id="low">Protein treatments; <br/>They do not absorb well into low porosity hair.</li>
    <li id="low">Silicones; <br/>They are used to smooth the cuticle, low porosity hair is already smooth and will just cause build up.</li>
    <li id="low">Butters; <br/>Just be aware when using these products and use them in small amounts because they also cause build up.</li>
  </ul>

</p>
<!--Medium porosity hair-->
<p id="medium" class="text1">Medium porosity hair <br/> <br/>
  Medium porosity hair is the easiest to manage. <br/>
  The hair cuticles are slightly opened, which means that moisture can reach inside the
  hair shaft but it's not lost quickly.
  Your hair usually doesn't take long to dry and gets wet easily.
  To maintain healthy hair you should clarify your hair frequently, moisturize it, use lightweight products and experiment with protein-rich products 
  to find out how much your hair really needs.
  Even with easily manageable hair you should avoid some things.

  <ul id="medium" class="text1">
    Avoid
    <li id="medium">Using harsh products</li>
    <li id="medium">Frequent heat styling</li>
    <li id="medium">Chemical treatments</li>
    <li id="medium">Using heaving products</li>
  </ul>
</p>





<!--High porosity hair-->
<p id="high" class="text1">High porosity hair <br/> <br/>
  Opposite to low porosity, the cuticle layer of high porosity hair does not lie flat, which means they're easy to penetrate, but it has issues in retaining that moisture.
  High porosity hair is mostly found in naturally wavy, curly and coily hair. Damaged hair also tends to have a higher porosity.
  High porosity hair tangles easily, gets wet quickly, tends to be frizzy and looks and feels dry.
  <br/>
  When detangling your hair use your fingers and conditioner, since your hair is more prone to breakage it's important to be gentle with it.
  There's a method called "LCO" that is widely used in the curly hair community.
  The "L" stands for liquid, "C" for cream and "O" for oil. It's best to use your hair products in that order because oil locks in moisture.
  Finally, opt for protein treatments, cream or oil based products and protective styling like braiding your hair.
  <ul id="high" class="text1">
  Avoid:
  <li id="high">Products with sulfates, parabens, silicones, and sodium laureth sulfates; <br/>
      They strip the hair of it's natural oils.
  </li>
  <li id="high">
    Washing your hair too often
  </li>
  <li id="high">
    Using heat on your hair; <br/>
    Straightening, curling with heat, hot water, etc.
  </li>
  <li id="high">Regular towels; <br/>
    Use a cotton t-shirt or a microfiber towel to reduce breakage
  </li>
  Instead opt for:
  <li id="high">Protective styling; <br/>
     Low manipulation hair styles like braids
  </li>
</ul>
